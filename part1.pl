% my_concat(L1, L2, L3): Determine if L3 is the concatination of L1 and L3.

% How does this function work?
% Ex 1. my_concat([a,b], [c,d], X)
%	  	([a,b], [c,d], [a,X])
%	  	([a], [c,d], [b,X])
%	  	([], [c,d], [c,d])
% 	  	We now know X is [c,d]... coming out of recursion
%	  	([a], [b,c], [b,c,d])
%	  	([a,b], [b,c], [a,b,c,d])

% Ex 2. my_concat([a,b], [c,d], [a,b,c,e])
%	  	([a,b], [c,d], [b,c,e])
%	  	([a], [c,d], [c,e])
%	  	([], [c,d], [c,e]) -> false
%

% element_at(X, N, L): Determine if element X is the Nth item in list L.

% element_at(a, N, l) where a and l are given and your program should output the solution for N.
% element_at(X, n, l) where n and l are given and your program should output the solution for X.
